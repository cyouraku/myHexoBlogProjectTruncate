\#139: Use Java system properties for http proxy (and other settings) by default.
This is a regression; it used to work this way in 1.8 and prior.

\#132: The proxy was erroneously sometimes appending "?null=" to a
request that had no query portion of the URL.
Thanks @pjunlin.

README updates.  Thanks Bruce Taylor, Gonzalo Fernández-Victorio
